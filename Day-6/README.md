# Overview

**EC2** stands for **Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud**.
In plain English: it’s a service from **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** that lets you rent **virtual computers (servers) in the cloud.**

# What you use EC2 for
- Running websites or web apps
- Hosting APIs or back-end services
- Data processing, machine learning, or batch jobs
- Basically anything you’d normally run on a physical server
# Key ideas
- Virtual machines: You spin up a server without buying hardware
- Scalable: Start small, then add or remove servers as needed
- Pay-as-you-go: You pay only for the time and resources you use
- Customizable: Choose CPU, memory, storage, OS (Linux, Windows, etc.)
# Super simple analogy
Think of EC2 like renting a computer in Amazon’s data center:
- You choose how powerful it is
- You remote into it
- You can shut it down anytime and stop paying
